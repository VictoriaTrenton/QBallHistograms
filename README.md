# QBallHistograms

## Description

This project was for my high-energy physics work term.

"This project generates formatted histograms measuring the reconstruction efficiency and background rejection of theoretical exotic particles in collisions. It also analyzes event data to distinguish exotic-particle signature from background sources."
