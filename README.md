# QBallHistograms

## Main Points

•	Designed scripts focusing on readability, usability, and scalability in Linux environment under minimal supervision for proposed Large Hadron Collider experiment

•	Generated formatted histograms measuring reconstruction efficiency and background rejection of theoretical exotic particles in collisions using shell and C++ scripts with data-analysis framework (ROOT)

•	Simulated events with particle-collision software (MadGraph) and analyzed event data using C++ algorithms with data-analysis framework (ROOT) to distinguish exotic-particle signature from background sources

## Description

This project was for my high-energy physics internship.

"This project generates formatted histograms measuring the reconstruction efficiency and background rejection of theoretical exotic particles in collisions. It also analyzes event data to distinguish exotic-particle signature from background sources."
